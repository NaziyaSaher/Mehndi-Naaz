# Mehndi-Naaz
–> Mehndi is a popular form of body art in South Asia, and is commonly applied during weddings for Sikh, Muslim, and Hindu brides. In Hindu and Sikh culture, a mehndi party is a pre-wedding celebration where the bride has a red-orange mehndi “stain” applied to her palms, the back of her hands, and her feet.
